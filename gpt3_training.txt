#Modules of approx. 200 residues, found at the N-terminus of GH33 sialidases. Can also be found inserted in the Î²-propeller of GH33 sialidases. The sialic acid binding function has been demonstrated for the N-terminal CBM40 of Vibrio cholerae sialidase
COEXISTS|GH33

#Modules of approx. 60 residues found in bacterial enzymes. Chitin-binding described in several cases. Distantly related to the CBM12 family.
RELATES|CBM12
BINDS|Chitin

#Modules of approx. 150 residues appended to the C-terminus of GH5 and GH26 enzymes. So far found exclusively in Ruminococcal enzymes. The R. flavefaciens module has been shown to bind decorated &beta;-1,4-glucans with a preference for xyloglucan.
